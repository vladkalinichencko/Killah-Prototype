# 🖋️ Killah - AI-Powered Writing Companion

*Welcome to Killah, where your creativity meets intelligent assistance!*

## ✨ What is Killah?

Killah is a **local-first, offline** writing application designed to augment your creativity, not replace it. Built natively for macOS with Swift and SwiftUI, Killah helps you bring your ideas to life with the assistance of "lil Pushkin" - our custom language model that runs entirely on your machine.

### 🎯 Our Philosophy

We believe that the best writing comes from **you**. Killah doesn't try to write for you - instead, it learns your style, understands your voice, and helps you continue your thoughts when you need that gentle nudge forward. Buy once, own forever - no subscriptions, no internet required, just you, your words, and intelligent assistance that truly belongs to you.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Caret System**: The text cursor becomes your creative companion, offering contextual suggestions exactly where you need them
- **🎙️ Voice Integration**: Speak your ideas and watch them flow onto the page with real-time voice-to-text
- **📚 Personal Learning**: Killah learns from your writing style to provide personalized suggestions that sound like *you*
- **🌐 Truly Offline**: Works without internet - your AI assistant is always available, wherever you are
- **💾 Smart Document Management**: Organize your work with intelligent file management and quick access to recent documents
- **🎨 Minimalist Design**: Clean, distraction-free interface that lets you focus on what matters - your writing
